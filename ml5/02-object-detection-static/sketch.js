// load our model & image before setup

  // load our object detection model `cocossd` – you could use `yolo` instead

  // draw dog photo
  image(pic, 0, 0);

  // loop through all our detections and draw them
  for (let object of detections) {

    // we use lerp to color the border somewhere between red and green based on the confidence of the prediction
    stroke(lerpColor(color(255,0,0), color(0, 255, 0), object.confidence));
    strokeWeight(3);
    noFill();
    // draw rectangle around a detection
    rect(object.x, object.y, object.width, object.height);

    // We could also use the normalised values, these represent the percentage
    // across the screen as a value between 0 and 1 – so we multiply these out
    // by the width and height of the canvas:
    // rect(object.normalized.x * pic.width,
    //      object.normalized.y * pic.height,
    //      object.normalized.width * pic.width,
    //      object.normalized.height * pic.height);

    // draw the label
    fill(255);
    noStroke();

    text(object.label, object.x + 10, object.y + 24);
  }

  // Ideas to explore:

  // Could you think of a way to show the user (without requiring them to look into the console) 
  // that the model is currently processing the image? You could use the fact that `detections` is 
  // empty, i.e. has a length of 0.

  // What about shifting the things you visualise? Instead of showcasing the original image, 
  // you could draw only the predicted labels, and/or only the bounding boxes, and use these as material for
  // some generative art.
}

// Our callback function!
function gotResults(err, results) {
  if (err) {
    console.log("We had an error with the detection:", err);
    return;
  }
  // remember our detections so that we can draw them in draw()
  detections = results;
  // if you want to see what `detections` look like
  console.log(detections);
