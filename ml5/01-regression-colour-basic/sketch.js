  Regression Example 01

  In this code we create colour markers on the screen, each time saving their coordinates
  and r,g,b values and providing them to our neural network.
  e.g. nnAddData(inputs, output); in mousePressed();

  Once we have enough points we call nnTrain();
  This trains the neural network.

  After it has trained, we ask the neural network to predict the colour for the mouse coordinates,
  reflected in the square on the bottom left corner of the canvas.

  Instructions:
  - Click to place a point
  - Press 1 to 3 to change the colour of the points
  - Press 't' to train the model

  IDEAS for experimentations: Play with a different number of inputs and/or outputs,
                              to understand how this NN system works. E.g., instead of taking
                              x and y as inputs, try using just one of them or a completely different one. 
                              For that, you would need to make the respective changes when you define your network
                              and whenever an input is fed into your NN. Can you think of cases where your system 
                              could take 1, 3 or more inputs, instead of the 2 of this example?
                              Similarly, can you think of cases where the NN predicts less or more than the 3 numbers
                              you currently get as output (r, g, b)? What if you affected only the red values of the
                              background or the diameter of a circle or a sound frequency, e.t.c.?

function nnPredict(input) {
  // The standard ML5js way to perform predictions is asyncronous, but async programming can be tricky.
  // Luckily the "predictSync" function forces ML5js to give us the result immediately and simplifies matters
  const res = nn.predictSync(input);

  // ML5 places each component of the prediction into an object.
  // as a result, the format of the output of a prediction is different from the one given as training data
  // E.g. if we trained the network with one input array [x] and an output array [a, b, c] one prediction will give
  // [{0:predicted_a, label: 0, value:predicted_a, unNormalizedValue: unnormalized_predicted_a},
  //  {1:predicted_b, label: 1, value:predicted_b, unNormalizedValue: unnormalized_predicted_b},
  //  {2:predicted_c, label: 2, value:predicted_c, unNormalizedValue: unnormalized_predicted_c}]
  // meaning that with "straight" ML5js we will need to parse these values and put them into our preferred format
  // (which is likely the one we provided in the first place as training data).
  //
  // If we provide an array of inputs (asking for multiple predictions), predictSync will return an array of such objects,
  // so here we handle the two cases

  // making it consistent with the input format
  if (Array.isArray(input[0])){ // checking if the value we pass in is an array
    // multiple predictions
    return res.map(element => element.map(v => v.value));
  } else {
    // make one prediction
    return res.map(v => v.value);
